\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I want to thank my supervisor Elizabeta Cavar for supporting me in the last six months.
Without her input and constant reminder of inofficial deadlines
It has always been motivating to work for this thesis as I always got good input from Jacqueline
(even if I'm still a professional at procrastinating). Also many thanks to Philippe Voinov who helped me setup the TypeScript environment. And a big thanks to my AOS-Team mates, David, Fischi and Adrian, who understood that I did not always have the time to work on our OS due to this thesis and being VIS-president at the same time (Combining these three things was certainty not the best idea I've ever had).
