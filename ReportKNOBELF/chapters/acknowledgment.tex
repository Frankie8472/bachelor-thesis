I want to thank my supervisor Elizabeta Cavar for supporting me in the last six months.
Without her input and constant reminder of our deadlines, I would have had a lot more obstacles on the way.
Also many thanks to Jaqueline Staub, Nicole Trachsler and Philippe Voinov for their help with specific topics on my work.
Another very important role in my work played the debuggers, the ones who tested my program and searched for any kind of problems.
Thank you for your time, effort and fun you had with my work:
Dilana Kunz, Guido von Burg, Julia Badertscher, Ronja Koeppel, Jonathan Chen
