\chapter*{Abstract}
The importance of computer science is gradually increasing. Games which support the development of abstract thinking,
analytical skills and decision-making, are becoming more and more interesting at an early age.
Through identification and describing relationships between items, children develop a foundation to early
math skills and basic concepts of computer science.
The pupils individual learning speed and lack of concentration, if not receiving the right amount of attention,
is another challenge by itself.
Without individual fostering, children are at high risk of losing interest.
Through this thesis the teachers will be introduced to a tool for their pupils.
Focused on classification of objects with certain properties,
the pupils get introduced to a computer-based learning environment.
There they can individually train and improve themselves in this field.
In the meantime the teachers can concentrate on the majority of their pupils and have the opportunity to work with
them on an individual basis, without feeling the pressure of having to support everyone at once.
It has shown, that gamification and game based learning has enormous potential.
It takes time to learn how to create games. Once overcome, creating further games is not as hard as one may think.
In the created test environment the test subjects have shown more concentration,
individual work behaviour and more willingness to learn than in the whole group.
